        <b>Smart Odor Sensor</b>
        <p>This is the small device placed in mushroom growing rooms. It checks the air
            for certain smells that are known to be early signs of trouble. It doesn’t need
            water, sunlight, or complicated setup—just place it and turn it on.</p>

    <div class="feature-card">
        <b>Mobile App</b>
        <p>The app shows what FreshSense is detecting. If the air is clean and healthy,
            everything will appear green. If something unusual starts to happen, the app
            changes color and sends a message like:<br>
            • “Warning: Possible mold activity in Room 2.”<br>
            • “Alert: Air quality changing—check humidity or ventilation.”<br>

    <h2>Who is FreshSense for?</h2>
    <p>
        FreshSense is designed for:<br><br>
        • Mushroom farmers growing oyster, shiitake, button, lion’s mane, and
        other varieties<br><br>
        • Indoor farm operators<br><br>
        • Vertical farms<br><br>
        • Substrate makers<br><br>
        • New growers who want better control over their grow rooms<br><br>
        Whether the farm is small or large, FreshSense brings modern protection that
        used to be available only in expensive laboratories.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Why Choose FreshSense?</h2>
    <p>
        FreshSense brings a new way of thinking to farming. Instead of reacting only
        when something looks wrong, FreshSense helps farmers act early—before the
        damage spreads. The goal is simple: give every mushroom farm the chance to
        run smoothly and successfully.<br><br>

        With FreshSense, farmers gain:<br><br>
        • Better harvest consistency<br><br>
        • Cleaner grow rooms<br><br>
        • Fewer disease outbreaks<br><br>
        • More confidence every growing cycle<br><br>
        • Higher income and lower waste<br><br>
    </p>
