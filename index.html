        Smart Odor Sensor
        <p>This is the small device placed in mushroom growing rooms. It checks the air
            for certain smells that are known to be early signs of trouble. It doesn’t need
            water, sunlight, or complicated setup—just place it and turn it on.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
    <p>
        FreshSense brings a new way of thinking to farming. Instead of reacting only
        when something looks wrong, FreshSense helps farmers act early—before the
        damage spreads. The goal is simple: give every mushroom farm the chance to
        run smoothly and successfully.

        With FreshSense, farmers gain:
        • Better harvest consistency
        • Cleaner grow rooms
        • Fewer disease outbreaks
        • More confidence every growing cycle
        • Higher income and lower waste
    </p>
